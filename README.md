# Project visualize Science___ for students.
# Visual_Planets
# for Chelsea's 5th grade class

This program is a test using the processing frame work.


this program takes in data from the planets in our solar system in the form of a .csv file 
and create a visualization of the planets orbiting around the sun.

This is just an example that I quickly put together to see if I could spark some Ideas in Chel's for better learning based visualization
